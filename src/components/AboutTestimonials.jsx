                        <p>Jonrie is one of my friends. We are not really close, but I feel good about him helping me with other schoolwork, especially in computer programming, about which I have no knowledge. When I chatted with him, he immediately helped me build the blog site about my school. For me jonrie is very nice person at realible.</p>

                        <p>Jonrie taught me programming since we were in Junior High School. Now that we are in college, he still teaches me new knowledge he gain. He is knowledgeable in web development-- he can do both front end and back end. As far as I know him, his skills includes: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, phpMyAdmin, MySQL and C++. He is very enthusiast, passionate, and hardworking person. I wish him the best and have the success he deserves.</p>

                        <p>For me, the amount of help that Jonrie did for us was so great that we could present something in defense; you did a great job. Your skill defines how good you are in your field. I hope you can improve and do more projects. I will highly recommend you to others who are looking to build their systems. The work is beautiful, and the system is smooth and well organized. Thank you</p>

                        <p>All I can say is that Jonrie's help with part of my project is a big help to me because I'm a bit weak in making codes. So thank you for helping me with my project; the amount of work I have to do has been reduced at least a little bit. I can say that you are nice to talk to, and you also responded right away, which was nice, and the help I got from you followed the layout of my project. Thank you.</p>

                        <p>Jonrie is good. We don't need to explain every single detail at first, and he has immediately built our capstone system, and the result is so good, especially since we demand specific functions that we need for our system, and he is budget-friendly for a developer. That's why we're really grateful since we're just mere students, and he doesn't pressure us, and the cooperation is so good that we meet the ends because of Jonrie, who is a very talented and kind developer.</p>
